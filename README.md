Current supported areas:
- geometry (the branch of mathematics concerned with properties of space such as the distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures)
- calculus (the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations)
- number theory (the branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and arithmetic functions)
